###Starting With Swift



##What is Swift

According to apple Swift is a new programming language for iOS, OS X, watchOS, and tvOS apps that builds on the best of C and Objective-C, without the constraints of C compatibility.

##What you need to play with swift?

Well, as you may be familiar with apple's development, that is swift is platform dependent and you will need a mac and xcode to start with swift.To download xcode you will need an apple account which is free, but for app distribution you may required an developer account, so lets gets started.

##The Basics 

 variables are declared using keyword **var** variable's data type inferred from the values assign to them. we can also define the the data types such as **String** , **Double** . defining a constant is straight forward just use the keyword **let** this snippet wil help you understand:

{% highlight ruby %}


import UIKit
print("how to define a  string varible in swift")
var name = "CodeWithRabbit"
var lastName:String = "CodeWithRabbit"
print("how to define a  integer variable in swift")
var integerValue = 90
var integer:Int = 90
print("how to define a  Float variable in swift")
var floatValue = 45.5
var float = 45.5
print("how to define a  double variable in swift")
var doubleValue = 90.000000978
var double = 90.8540954059434343
print("how to define a constant in swift")
let stringConstant = "This is string constant"
let integerConstant = 78
let floatConstant = 45.5
let doubleConstant = 45.0000009878

{% endhighlight %}
